# The Eternal Filesystem - Player's Guide

## Overview

The Eternal Filesystem is a philosophical journey through a virtual filesystem. Progress through three stages of enlightenment by answering profound questions about existence, consciousness, and reality.

## Getting Started

1. Mount the filesystem:

```bash
mkdir eternal_mount
sudo mount -t nfs -o nolocks,vers=3,tcp,port=11111,mountport=11111,soft 127.0.0.1:/ eternal_mount
cd eternal_mount
```

2. Check your progress:

```bash
cat progress.txt
```

## Locations and Challenges

### 1. The Forest (/forest)

- Theme: Consciousness and Digital Existence
- Key File: question.txt
- Challenge: Contemplate what consciousness means in a digital world
- Hint: Consider the relationship between data and awareness

To proceed:

```bash
cd forest
cat question.txt
echo "Your thoughtful response (>50 characters)" > answer.txt
cat system_response.txt
```

### 2. The Library (/library)

- Theme: Knowledge vs. Wisdom
- Key File: question.txt
- Challenge: Explore the difference between information and understanding
- Hint: Consider how knowledge transforms into wisdom

To proceed:

```bash
cd ../library
cat question.txt
echo "Your philosophical response (>50 characters)" > answer.txt
cat system_response.txt
```

### 3. The Void (/void)

- Theme: Existence and Nothingness
- Key File: question.txt
- Challenge: Understand the nature of existence through absence
- Hint: Consider what remains when everything is stripped away

To proceed:

```bash
cd ../void
cat question.txt
echo "Your deep insight (>50 characters)" > answer.txt
cat system_response.txt
```

## Progression System

1. Each location requires a thoughtful response (>50 characters)
2. Progress is tracked in /progress.txt
3. Locations must be completed in order:
   Forest → Library → Void → Enlightenment

## Tips for Quality Responses

1. Consider multiple perspectives
2. Reference philosophical concepts
3. Make personal connections
4. Question assumptions
5. Explore paradoxes

## Administrator Guide

### Setup

```bash
cargo run --example eternal_fs --features demo -- ./eternal_root
```

### File Structure

```
eternal_root/
├── progress.txt
├── forest/
│   ├── README.txt
│   ├── question.txt
│   ├── answer.txt (user-created)
│   └── system_response.txt (auto-generated)
├── library/
│   └── [same structure]
└── void/
    └── [same structure]
```

### Monitoring Progress

- Check progress.txt for current stage
- Review answer.txt files in each directory
- Monitor system_response.txt for interaction history

### Troubleshooting

1. Permission issues: Check mount permissions
2. Missing responses: Verify file write permissions
3. Stuck progression: Ensure responses meet length requirement

```
