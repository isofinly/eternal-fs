# Eternal Filesystem: A Philosophical Journey

## Introduction

Welcome to "Eternal Filesystem," a mind-blowing game that blends the technical intricacies of a Network File System (NFS) with profound philosophical exploration. Navigate through a meticulously designed filesystem that represents various philosophical domains, each offering a unique perspective on reality, identity, and existence. This game is an immersive adventure that challenges your understanding of the world and your place in it.

## What is This Game About?

"Eternal Filesystem" is not just a game; it's an experience. Players embark on a journey through directories and files that represent different philosophical concepts such as logic, emotion, identity, and more. Each interaction is a step towards enlightenment, where thoughtful responses and explorations shape your progression through the game.

## How to Play

1. **Mount the Filesystem:**

   To begin your journey, you need to mount the filesystem. Use the following commands:

   ```bash
   cargo run --example eternal_fs --features demo -- ./eternal_root
   ```

   In another terminal:

   ```bash
   mkdir eternal_mount
   sudo mount -t nfs -o nolocks,vers=3,tcp,port=11111,mountport=11111,soft 127.0.0.1:/ eternal_mount
   cd eternal_mount
   ```

2. **Explore and Interact:**

   - Navigate through directories like `/logic`, `/emotion`, and `/identity`.
   - Read and write to files that pose philosophical questions and challenges.
   - Reflect on your responses and their implications on your journey.

3. **Progress Through Stages:**

   - Complete challenges in each philosophical domain to advance to the next stage.
   - Track your progress by reading `progress.txt`.

4. **Engage with Special Files:**

   - Explore special files like `quantum_state.txt`, `perception.txt`, and `timeline.txt` to gain deeper insights into the game's themes.

5. **Multiplayer Mode:**

   - **Join Forces:** Team up with friends to tackle philosophical challenges together!
   - **Philosophical Debates:** Engage in friendly debates over the nature of existence. Just remember, no one likes a "know-it-all" in the realm of philosophy!
   - **Shared Discoveries:** Explore the filesystem as a group, sharing insights and responses to unlock new paths and challenges.

This project utilizes the nfsserve library by xetdata, available at [https://github.com/xetdata/nfsserve](https://github.com/xetdata/nfsserve). We are grateful for the foundational work and support provided by the author, which made this philosophical NFS adventure possible.

## TODO: Future Enhancements

- **Timeline Instability:**

  - Introduce elements where the filesystem changes unpredictably, reflecting the chaos of existence.
  - Implement a feature where the game could delete itself based on certain player actions, symbolizing the impermanence of reality.

- **Random Events:**

  - Incorporate random events that challenge the player's assumptions and force them to adapt their understanding.
  - Add dynamic challenges that change the game's landscape and require creative problem-solving.

- **Advanced Philosophical Themes:**

  - Explore additional philosophical concepts like ethics, aesthetics, and metaphysics.
  - Introduce new directories and challenges that delve deeper into the nature of existence and knowledge.

## Conclusion

"Eternal Filesystem" is a unique blend of technical innovation and philosophical depth. It invites players to think critically about fundamental questions of reality, identity, and existence, all within the unique framework of an NFS environment. Join us on this journey of discovery and enlightenment.
